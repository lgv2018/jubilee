# Changelog

All changes between releases are tracked here.

## rel/jubilee 2.2.0 - Dec 2, 2020
- More Permissive License!
  - Jubilee is licensed under Creative Commons 4.0 International License
  - Dropping the former "Share-Alike" restriction
- Massive Frame Assembly Instruction Overhaul
  - All M5 Drop-in T Nuts have been replaced with M5 Stamped Slide-in T Nuts. The former do not always seat properly into the extrusion when they are being installed.
  - Frame assembly instructions have been totally revamped to pre-load Slide-in T Nuts during assembly.
  - All M3 Slide-in T Nuts (used for connecting MGN12 rail to the 2020 extrusions) have been replaced with [Stamped M3 Slide In T-Nuts](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32803077280.html) which are consistently better quality from Aliexpress
  - The process of squaring the outer frame makes better use of the Machinist Blocks, which means...
  - The 8x outer_frame_squaring_plate.STLs are no longer needed.
- Leadscrew Retainers are no longer needed. They have been removed from the assembly instructions.
  - As is, they were overconstraining the z axis screws.

### Config/Macro Changes
- Adding a RepRapFirmware 3+ Config Files for Duet2 + Duex5 boards
- Adding Safety and "tool-loaded" Checks to homing macros before executing a homing move. -- [contributed by @ProbiusSC](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/pull/133)
- bed.g
  - disabling mesh compensation at the beginning and re-enabling at the end. This is a precaution in case bed.g is called as a standalone macro. homez.g already disables mesh compensation before calling bed.g.

### Changes to Printed Parts
- [BZP-04](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/back_z_motor_plate.STL)
  - Added 1mm of height to where motor attaches to be consistent with the other two Z Motor Plates
- [LZP-04](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/front_left_z_motor_plate.STL)
  - Opened up M5 Screw Holes to 5.8mm to prevent collision of Slide-In TNut with Inside Corner Bracket 
- [RZP-04](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/front_right_z_motor_plate.STL)
  - Opened up M5 Screw Holes to 5.8mm to prevent collision of Slide-In TNut with Inside Corner Bracket 


### Shopping List Changes
- Fastener Sheet
  - All fasteners have been pulled into a separate tab.
  - All fasteners are now available as a single purchase from Filastruder
- M5 Stamped TNuts Introduced
  - These replace all M5 Drop-In TNuts
- Stamped TNut Backing Springs
- Keenovo Silicone Heated Pad Part Number Substitute
  - Replaced original Bed Heater with the one that includes a built-in 150C thermal cutoff for $3 more.
- Default BMG Extruder Shopping List
  - [Metal Tool Plates](https://shop.guildtek.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1&products_id=4) available from Guildtek are now the default. These do not warp like the plastic ones do. Fixes [Issue #26](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/issues/26).
  

## rel/jubilee 2.1.2 - Sept 29, 2020
- Injection Molded Delrin Wedge Plates are now the standard for designing tool plates. Fixes [Issue #43](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/issues/43)
  - added injection molding specs sheet and STEP file with draft angles.
- Logo added to a [folder](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/tree/master/logo) in the main repository, courtesy of @troll on Discord
- Side and Back Panels for the frame are now available in HDPE from Filastruder. They are line items in the BOM.
- The Carriage Pulley now has an extra square nut to better resist plastic fatigue when screwed onto the Twist Lock.
- Added DXFs of Side and Back Panels to the [machineable parts folder](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/tree/master/frame/fabrication_exports/machined_parts/panels). These variants are router-friendly with the inclusion of Dogbone Fillets on inside corners for machining with up to a 3.175mm (1/8th in.) diameter endmill.
- Parking Post Part Number Corrected. The XX in PPBXX-04 and THXX-04 now reflect the dowel pin center-to-center distance.
  - PPB47-04 and TH47-04 regenerated, which are the correct parking post files for the pen tool.
  - PPB55-05 and TH55-05 created, which are the correct parking post files for the default extruder.
- Parking Post geometry updated for stiffness. It now uses a dovetail feature inspired by @Mr. Hobbit on Discord.
  - M3 8mm screws have been replaced with M3 10mm screws.
  - Instructions updated to reflect the new parking post geometry.
  
## Default Extruder Changes
- Replaced Delrin Compression Flexure with O-Rings. These are easier to source than a custom laser-cut Delrin part, but the old Delrin piece is still a viable option.
  - O-Rings should get a teeny bit of grease. (The same stuff as the leadscrews will work.)
- Tool Wings stick out an extra 5mm. The "pre-park" position has been backed off to 295mm in Y in the tool change macros to account for the extra distance. Overall build volume is unchanged.
  
### Config/Macro Changes
- config.g machine XY origin adjusted to reflect the documentation. (It was off by a couple mm.) Fixes [Issue #88](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/issues/88)
- XY Motor current has been increased to 2263mA. This is 80% of the peak current limit. (Note that LDO motor current limits are listed as *root mean square* not *peak* current values in the datasheet, so the *peak* current limit is 2829mA.)
- Tool Change Macros have been rewritten for more general use cases.
  - Tool Change Macros restore the Z height before pulling out the tool. This prevents tools from crashing into the bed when changing from a short to a tall tool.

### Changes to Printed Parts
- Carriage Pulley, [CPL-02](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/toolchanger/toolchange_carriage/carriage_pulley.STL)

### Shopping List Changes
- Online Metals is now no longer a required supplier for frame components.
  - Side panel raw material has been replaced with three already-machined side panels from Filastruder.

  - +1 M3, 10mm set screw
  - +1 M3 Square Nut
- Default Extruder
  - +4 5mm ID, 9mm OD O-rings
- Parking Post
  - -2 M3, 8mm Buttonhead Screws
  - +2 M3, 10mm Buttonhead Screws

- Carriage Center Plate now has heat set inserts
- Z-axis motor plates
    - now have a chamfer on the bottom surface for better printability across a range of printers. (This change removes the effect of elephant's foot.)
	- Cutout for vertical extrusions has also been shrunk such that it can act as a locating feature.
    - offset added between the motor and the plate such that the leadscrews don't "bottom out" inside the coupler

- Replace Remote Elastic Lock. (Don't actually do this unless you haven't assembled it yet.)

## Hotfix to Jubilee 2.0.2 - May 18, 2020
If your are using printed corner plates, not the Delrin plates, and they do not fit with your pulley stackup, reprint these updated versions. This version is slightly more forgiving adding 0.2mm of tolerance in the Z dimension.
- LXR-03 [Left Crossbar Pulley Reinforcement Plate](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/left_crossbar_pulley_reinforcement_plate.STL) has a smaller diameter offset face to not interfere with the pulleys. Also: chamfer for easier shoulder screw insertion
- RXR-03 [Right Crossbar Pulley Reinforcement Plate](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/right_crossbar_pulley_reinforcement_plate.STL)  has a smaller diameter offset face to not interfere with the pulley. Also: chamfer for easier shoulder screw insertion
- LCR-03 [Left Corner Pulley Reinforcement Plate](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/left_corner_pulley_reinforcement_plate.STL) has a smaller diameter offset face to not interfere with the pulley. Also: chamfer for easier shoulder screw insertion
- RCR-03 [Right Corner Pulley Reinforcement Plate](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/right_corner_pulley_reinforcement_plate.STL) has a smaller diameter offset face to not interfere with the upper pulley. Also: chamfer for easier shoulder screw insertion

## Hotfix to Jubilee 2.0.2 - April 27, 2020
If your are using printed corner plates, not the Delrin plates, reprint them:
- LXR-02 [Left Crossbar Pulley Reinforcement Plate](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/left_crossbar_pulley_reinforcement_plate.STL) has a smaller diameter offset face to not interfere with the pulleys. Also: chamfer for easier shoulder screw insertion
- RXR-02 [Right Crossbar Pulley Reinforcement Plate](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/right_crossbar_pulley_reinforcement_plate.STL)  has a smaller diameter offset face to not interfere with the pulley. Also: chamfer for easier shoulder screw insertion
- LCR-02 [Left Corner Pulley Reinforcement Plate](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/left_corner_pulley_reinforcement_plate.STL) has a smaller diameter offset face to not interfere with the pulley. Also: chamfer for easier shoulder screw insertion

Also: chamfer for easier shoulder screw insertion


## rel/jubilee_2.0.2 - Apr 11, 2020

### Major Fixes/Updates from Jubilee 2.0.1
- The frame is now Gates Pulley Compatible.
    - Either Genuine Gates pulleys or generic pulleys can be dropped into the machine. Note that Gates Pulleys are slightly taller, so shims and washers have been called out in the instructions to handle the height differences. Several printed parts have been adjusted, and they are called out below.
- All Delrin Corner Plates are now 3D printed except the Cinch Plates. (You can still use the laser-cut ones, but you may need to add shim.)
    - This is to to handle intercompatibility with Gates/Generic pulleys. The Gates pulleys require taller shoulder screws, so I've opted for thickening these parts instead of adding shim.
- Metal Motor Plate Changes
    - Both Motor Plates now have a counterbore feature to accommodate the thicker motor spacer. This change was driven by the geometry changes to make the Gates pulleys a drop-in replacement.
- Printed Motor Plate changes
    - slot for the stepper motor is now 11.4mm in radius to accomodate coarse 3D printer tolerances. Fixes [issue #68](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/issues/68)
    - Printed Right Motor Plate now has a deeper counterbore feature
- CAD Model Changes
    - CAD model now displays the aluminum crossbar instead of the 6mm carbon fiber one. The carbon fiber crossbar is preserved as a reference in another configuration.
	- All M5 Low Profile screw models were replaced with buttonheads, which is what the shopping list specifies.
	- Solidworks Model Zip file has been replaced with all components in their original folder structure. No longer requires using Git-LFS, which had bandwidth limits.
	- Front Left and Front Right MGN12 Rails attach to the 2020 extrusion with 5 screw, not 4 screws, to be conisistent with the back Z rail. Fixes [Issue #72](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/issues/72)
- Z Axis Assembly Changes
    - Spacing between dowel pins is now consistent on all three bed couplers. Fixes [Issue #59](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/issues/59)
    - All three printed components that couple the bed to the frame have heat-set inserts
	- Bed springs now connect with a bent solder terminal lug
    - Spring Stock for the bed springs has been replaced with proper 15mm springs
    - Overall, adding springs to the bed is now much easier to assemble and remove.
- Carriage Changes
    - added a spacer inside the carriage center plate on the Twist Lock Assembly to remove axial force on the carriage pulley (performance improvement) Addresses [Issue #58](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/issues/58)
	- replaced M3 16mm Flathead screws with Buttonhead screws (reduces unique part count)
	- Twist lock has been bumped forward 0.2mm to improve compatibility with picking up E3D tool plates
	- Carriage Back Plate has a Zip Tie tab for better Z axis cable management
	- Carriage Center Plate now has enough space to accomodate a variant of the current limit switch (PN: D2HW-C202MR), which has flying leads.
- Default Tool/Extruder Changes
    - Wedge Plate Geometry has been bumped forward ~0.35mm to change twist lock "logking" position to be slightly less than 180 degrees.
	- Screw holes for the fan shround have been bumped down slightly.
- Electronics Back Panel Changes
    - M5 panel mounting screws have been scooched over a few mm to make space for installation with the XY motors installed
	- cutout has been added in the corner to make room for the 3D Printed PSU Socket
	- Pocket for Bed wires has been relocated upwards in prep for a cable chain on the bed
	- Bed SSR has been relocated upwards in prep for a cable chain on the bed
- 120v Side Panel Changes
    - PSU cutout has been removed and replaced with a printed part. This change makes the power inlet socket much easier to swap for alternates.
	- The four M5 Screw holes in the corner have been scooched in 5mm
- Ethernet Side Panel Changes
	- Four M5 Screw holes in the corner have been scooched in 5mm
- Updated instructions for
    - toolchanger carriage assembly
    - bed plate
	- double pulley corner plates
	- left and right motor corner plates (and upgrade)
	- Z axis assembly. New instructions for bent terminal lugs.
	- heat set insert list
	- default extruder. Fixes [Issue #70](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/issues/70)

### Shopping List Changes
- The 2.0.1 Y axis limit switch (Part Num: D2HW-BL201H) has been reverted to the original switch from 2.0 (Part Num: D2HW-C201H).
    - The original Right Motor Plate Spacer was too short to fully embed the Y axis switch, but resizing for the Gates pulley option added enough space to add the original switch in. Overall, reducing the unique part count makes the project easier to order and assemble.
- Shoulder Screws are now sourced from [Filastruder](https://www.filastruder.com/collections/railcore/products/shoulder-screws-bolts?variant=17989593104455), which is slightly cheaper than McMaster-Carr.
- All six 20mm long, 5mm diameter shoulder screws have been replaced with 25mm long versions.
- The three Bed Retension Springs are now a stock part from [Aliexpress](https://aliexpress.com/item/33043988987.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.447133edZMsmcq). (Order the 15mm version.)
    - 2.0.1 (and before) had instructions for making your own springs out of spring stock. This was a TON of extra work for a part you can just buy.
- Bed Retension Clips are now a different type of Terminal Lug
    - The three Keystone [7328](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/keystone-electronics/7328/36-7328-ND/316697) Terminal Lugs on the bed and the three M2 set screws have been replaced by six [4000](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/keystone-electronics/4000/36-4000-ND/316071) Terminal Lugs, which are much easier to bend around the spring.
- three more M3 heat set inserts
- pack of washers for generic pulleys.
- The Belleville disc spring is no longer required and has been removed
- The four M3, 16mm Flathead screws on the Carriage Front Plate have been replaced with four M3 12mm long Buttonhead screws.
- Previous Power Inlet Socket from Amazon (ASIN: B07C184P7L) now has two alternates listed from Digikey (Part Num: CCM2178-ND‎) and Mouser (Part Num: 446-084.01001.00-RSI).
    - The alternates are twin fused to account for a short-to-ground failure mode in a Hot-Hot 220V configuration (rare, but possible in some countries). They are set to become the primary power inlet sockets in a future revision.


### Config File Changes
- In **config.g**, the machine's XY Origin has been adjusted to be relative to the carriage's ZProbe location when no tools are present. See the [Frame Layout](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/wiki/Frame-Layout) for diagrams.
    - *bed.g* has been adjusted to reflect the new "ZProbe-Centric" origin
    - **tfreeX.g**, **tpreX.g**, and **tpostX.g** have had their parking post locations adjusted to reflect the new "ZProbe-Centric" XY origin.
    - tools are now released 1m behind where they are picked up. This is such that they can be pushed in Y first to contact the tool balls before locking them. This is a workaround until we get nice slippy Delrin replacement plates.
    - **tool_lock.g** now includes a slight 0.5mm push forward while engaging the twist lock.

### Updating from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2
If you would like to have the future option of updating to genuine Gates pulleys, the following part **must** be reprinted

- PSH-01 [PSU Socket Holder](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/psu_socket_holder.STL) (New!)
    - This part to replace the acrylic cutout, which was brittle and prone to cracking. It's also easier to modify a 3D printed part for slightly different sized PSU sockets. 
	
The following parts were tweaked for aesthetics:
- LMS-04 [Left Motor Plate Spacer](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/left_motor_corner_bracket_spacer.STL)

## rel/jubilee_2.0.1 - Mar 10, 2020

### Major Fixes/Updates from 2.0
- The [Aluminum Crossbar](https://www.mandalaroseworks.com/jubilee/crossbar) is now available from Mandala Rose Works for $80. It is now the default in the BOM. Should you choose to upgrade from the carbon fiber crossbar, you will need to:
    - Print the latest [Right Motor Plate Spacer](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/right_motor_corner_bracket_spacer.STL)
    - Print the [X Limit Trigger](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/upgrades/aluminum_crossbar/fabrication_exports/stls/x_limit_trigger.STL)
    - purchase 1x M3, 10mm standoff from [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/95947a006)
    - purchase 1x M3, 16mm buttonhead screw from [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/92095a184) or [Bolt Depot](https://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=7222)
    - purchase 1x D2HW-BL201H from [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=D2HW-BL201H)
    - Optional: replace the sixteen M3, 12mm buttonhead screws for bolting in the rail with M3, 10mm screws instead
- Adjusted Parking Post for the default extruder such that the tool doesn't twist while being picked up. Updated [assembly instructions](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/tools/jubilee_tools/tool_posts/configurable_tool_post/assembly_instructions/parking_post_assembly_instructions.pdf)
- Adjusted the Carriage Back Plate and pulley spacers such that the nominal position of both belts is coplanar, rather than slightly off. Fixes [Issue #14](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/issues/14).
- swapped M3 nuts and for heat set inserts int the Carriage Back Plate to add clearance for the aluminum crossbar upgrade.
- Updated the instructions to show how to properly install the composite _Keep Nuts_ into the carbon fiber crossbar. Fixes [Issue #15](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/issues/15).
- Re-exported latest STL files for Extruder Tool
- Added an "Upgrades" folder for alternate frame components
- Tweaked direct drive extruder to fix compatibility issue when assembling for a V6 hotend.
- Adding Heatsinks to default extruder BOM for the stepper motors as they can get hot enough to warp the tool plates

The following parts *must* be reprinted since rel/jubilee-1.0:
- CPB-02 [Carriage Back Plate](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/toolchanger/toolchange_carriage/carriage_back_plate.STL)
- [Belt Clasp](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/belt_clasp.STL)
- PPS-02 [Printed Pulley Spacer](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/printed_pulley_spacer.STL)
- PPB47-03 [Parking Post Base](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/tools/jubilee_tools/tool_posts/configurable_tool_post/fabrication_exports/parking_post_base_47mm.STL)
- TH47-03 [Tool Holder](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/tools/jubilee_tools/tool_posts/configurable_tool_post/fabrication_exports/tool_holder_47mm.STL)

The following parts were tweaked, but do not need to be reprinted if you have already assembled your machine.
- LMS-03 [Left Motor Plate Spacer](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/left_motor_corner_bracket_spacer.STL) has a bumper feature to make the y rails easier to install in a consistent spot.
- RMS-04 [Right Motor Plate Spacer](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/master/frame/fabrication_exports/3d_printed_parts/frame/right_motor_corner_bracket_spacer.STL) has a bumper feature to make the y rails easier to install in a consistent spot.

### Minor Fixes/Tweaks
- Most printed parts now have part numbers with the revision id on them. This feature is useful for identifying what version of a part you have to decide whether you need to upgrade to a newer revision in the future
- Fixed old V1-related graphics in Remote Elastic Lock Instructions. Some photos are still out of date, but the whole is useable in its current state.
- Reorganized file structure to clearly separate tools from frame
- M3 Drop-in T nuts have been replaced with M3 Slide-in T nuts, which are cheaper and less of a hassle to install.
- Y axis limit switch was moved forward by 0.2mm to ensure that it clicks even on poorly printed parts.

## rel/jubilee-2.0 - Jan 15, 2020

### Added
- Jubilee V2, *Cubilee*
- New [Bill of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pRzBQxVzL9c4T9b1RrKvSjlSwJJhJ7NcbSV6iJUv0X0/edit?usp=sharing). All parts that were added, changed-in-size, or increased in value since the V1 BOM are highlighted in yellow.

### Changed
- Frame was adjusted to accommodate larger tools and a build volume of 300x300x300mm. Size update also fixes issue [#4](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/issues/4)
- Dowel pin spacing on the Coupling Plate was modified slightly to more easily lock E3D tool plates
- Back Panel bolt hole pattern now accommodates either a set of Duet2 + Duex5 boards or a set of Duet3 + 2 expansion boards + Raspi 
- Front opening has more clearance for bed plate removal 
- ZYLTech Leadscrews are now 375mm instead of 270mm
- Side Panel Sizes are slightly larger
